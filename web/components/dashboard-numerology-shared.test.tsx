/**
 * Coverage for the two numerology display rules that are *silent* when broken —
 * neither shows up as a crash, a type error, or a failed request.
 *
 * 1. **Doctrine D6 — the compound surrogate.** When `compoundBeyondSeries` is
 *    non-null, `compound` is a reduced stand-in for a number Cheiro's 10–52
 *    series never reaches. Printing it bare attributes one number's meaning to a
 *    different number, and it looks completely normal on screen. Ten of twelve
 *    realistic three-part Indian document names measured past 52, so this is the
 *    ordinary case for a full legal name, not a corner.
 *
 * 2. **The prose gate.** `readingsAvailable: false` means the server computed a
 *    reading and withheld the sentences pending Tamil native review. A UI that
 *    renders nothing looks identical to a UI that has nothing to say, and the
 *    difference is the whole point of the field existing.
 *
 * Both are asserted on the shared primitives rather than on each screen, because
 * every screen renders numbers through these.
